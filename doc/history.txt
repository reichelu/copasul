20170125: 0.2.1
	  bugfix cost.styl_gnl_file: accent batch augmentation in
  	  stereo files fixed
20170130: 0.2.2
	  bugfix coex.export_rhy: now working for stereo files
20170131: --> version 0.3
20170203: 0.3.1
	  pho featset now also usable for augmentation with unit=file
          (so far the combination of unit=file and wgt:pho=1 lead to
	  an non-infomative error)
20170206: 0.3.2
	  bugfix cost.styl_rhy_file: now working for stereo files
20170216: 0.3.3
	  bugfix copl.plot_browse_channel: declination plot now possible
	  also without preceding local contour stylization
20170224: 0.3.4
	  bugfix coag:aug_loc_fv: now returns the same number of arguments
	  for ag_select='left|right|max'
20170224: 0.3.5
	  bugfix coag:aug_fv_mrg: higher numpy versions do not support
	  column concat with empty arrays. append() calls corrected
	  accordingly.
20170306: 0.3.6
	  bugfix coag:aug_annot_init(): empty string default for timeStamp
	  cost:styl_glob(): eval for N=0 no robust NaN instead of error
20170321: 0.3.7
	  cost:styl_std_feat(): duration 'dur' features now calcaluated
	  more precisely based on original segment on- and offsets.
	  So far it was derived from the number of f0 samples in the
	  resp. segment
20170327: 0.3.8
	  index column removed from csv output to ease reading with R
20170328: 0.3.9
	  file path to csv omitted in R template output 
20170405: 0.3.10
	  bugfix: file part omission in R template output
	  file stems containing a '.' are not further
	  split into stem and extension
20170502: 0.3.11
	  coag:aug_syl(): now robust if time info in annotation exceeds
	  		  signal file length
	  coag:aug_annot_upd(): now also outputting (empty) tiers if no
	  	          event extracted. Before a missing tier lead to
			  an error if needed for stylization. Empty tier
			  info is written to log file.
	  copp:pp_tier_time_to_tab(): adjusted to cope with empty tiers
          copp:pp_f_rate(): adjusted to cope with empty tiers
	  cost:styl_std_feat(): now robust against empty signal input
          config fsys:export:fullpath: +/- fullpath switch to
	  	 csv tables in R code output
20170516: 0.3.12
	  - fixed a bug resulting from version update 0.3.7
	  In cost:styl_std_feat() calls now not only segment but event tiers
	  are correctly processed.
	  - bugfix: for 'loc' feature set extraction customized options
	  preproc:loc:{point|nrm}_win not anymore overwritten by default
	  preproc:{point|nrm}_win values of 0.5 and 1s, respectively
          - coag:aug_pho_nrm()
	    - vowel duration normalization by median devision
	    replaced by robust z-scores
20170522: 0.4.1
	  - added global segment features:
	    {bl|ml|tl|rng}_rate, i.e.
	    base/mid/topline/range rate (ST or Hz per sec)
	  - added extended local segment features:
	    {bl|ml|tl|rng}_{c0|c1|rate}, i.e.
	    base/mid/topline/range intercept, slope, and rate (ST or Hz per sec)
          - cost:styl_rhy()
            * the proportion of event-rate-related DCT coefficients is
	    calculated relative to the coefficients with frequencies between
	    lb and ub (before: all coefficients, which makes comparisons
	    across different signal lengths hard to interprete)
	    * same for mean absolute error: IDCT by the event-rate-related
	    DCT coefficients is compared with the IDCT by the coefficients
	    with frequencies between lb and ub
20170718: 0.4.2
	  - some plot:browse options added for index verbose and selected
	    plotting
20170905: 0.4.3
          - time stamps (t_on, t_off) added to boundary feature output
20170921: 0.4.4
	  - bugfix in spectral moment calculation in sigFunc.py:specmom()
20171010: 0.4.5
	  - bugfix: annotation augmentation now works also from scratch, i.e.
	    without pre-given annotation files
20171011: 0.5.1
	  - summary output added: mean and variation measures for all
	  extracted features (unigram entropy for contour classes) per file
20171117: 0.5.2
	  - more robust processing of TextGrids with empty tiers
20171120: 0.6.1
	  - reference value for semitone conversion can now be calculated
	  not only separately for each file/channel, but for any
	  grouping variable, e.g. separately for each speaker
20171120: 0.6.2
	  - new features: mean values for base-, mid-, topline, and range
	  (bl_m, ml_m, tl_m, rng_m)
	  - bugfix in copasul.py at call of coin.copa_opt_init()
	  (bug since version 0.6.1)
20171211: 0.6.3
	  - new rhy_f0/en features from DCT spectrum:
	  Number of peaks in absolute DCT spectrum (n peak), corresponding
	  frequency for coefficient with amplitude maximum (f max), and
	  frequency difference for each selected prosodic event
	  rate to f max (dgm) and to the nearest peak (dlm).
	  - new config parameter peak_prct for DCT peak candidates
	  - bugfix: styl.register == 'none' now works with
	  navigate.do_clst_loc
20171221: 0.6.4
	  - informative error message for zero-only f0 input 
20180110: 0.7.1
	  - new features added to gnl feature set for both energy and f0:
	  qi, qf, qb, qm, c0, c1, c2
	  - copasul_preproc.pp_channel(): for feature sets loc, and loc_ext
	  missing local segments are not anymore replaced by the corresponding
	  global segment. So far a global segment without any contained local
	  one was treated as a global segment containing one local one of the
	  same size.
20180112: 0.7.2
	  - sigFunc.dct_peak(): maximum finder now robust against multiple
	  maxima
20180118: 0.7.3
	  - default values for outlier removal changed
	  preproc:out:f = 2 (unchanged)
	  preproc:out:m = 'mean'
	  - median-based outlier definition changed: now
	  Tukey's fences used, i.e. outliers defined wrt
	  1st and 3rd quartiles
